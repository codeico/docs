## 🛡️ Validator

Validators are essential to the 0G network, playing a key role in securing the system and participating in consensus. They propose and validate new blocks, helping maintain network integrity while earning rewards for their contribution.

This guide covers:

- **Validator Installation**: Quick and easy setup with just a few commands — get your validator up and running in minutes, complete with all dependencies.
- **Wallet & Key Setup**: Instructions for creating or importing wallets and generating validator keys.
- **Validator Registration**: Steps to register as an active validator on the 0G Labs network.
- **Monitoring & Maintenance**: Helpful commands for monitoring validator status and ensuring optimal performance.

## 📦 Storage Node

Storage Nodes are vital to maintaining the decentralized storage layer in the 0G network. They store and serve data, ensuring availability and reliability across the network. By running a Storage Node, you contribute to the network while earning rewards.

This guide includes:

- **One-Click Installation**: Simple command-based install for both standard and turbo configurations.
- **Manual Setup**: Detailed instructions for setting up manually.
- **Snapshot Integration**: Guide on integrating snapshots to accelerate syncing.
- **Useful Commands**: Key commands for monitoring and managing your node.

👉 [Go to Storage Node Guide](./storage-node/install)

## 🧵 Snapshot Service

Snapshots offer pre-synced data to help new Storage Nodes sync quickly without starting from block 0. They’re especially helpful after testnet resets or fresh installations.

Features include:

- **Snapshot Status**: View current snapshot availability and block height.
- **Installation**: One-click install or manual restore options available.

## 🧠 Data Availability (DA) Node

DA Nodes are responsible for verifying, signing, and storing encoded blob data. They ensure data submitted on-chain is available and provable.

This guide provides:

- **Requirements**: Hardware and staking prerequisites.
- **Installation Steps**: Full instructions to install packages, set up the environment, and build the project.
- **Configuration**: Guidance on editing config files and setting up services.
- **Node Management**: Commands for starting, stopping, and removing the node.

## 🛰️ DA Client

The 0G DA Client is a tool to interact with DA Nodes by submitting, encoding, and storing data blobs. It also supports data retrieval and availability verification via a built-in Retriever API. Typically, it runs in a containerized environment and integrates with validator stacks or other tools.

- **Installation**: Uses Docker to run a custom-built image from source.
- **Environment Configuration**: Requires setting up private keys and DA encoder addresses.

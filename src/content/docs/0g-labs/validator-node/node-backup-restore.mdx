title: Node Backup & Restore Guide
description: How to safely backup and restore your 0G validator node and wallet.
---

## Part 1: Backing Up the Node

### Stop the Node

```bash
sudo systemctl stop 0gd.service
```

### Backup the Wallet Private Key (Ethereum)

Export your Ethereum wallet private key:

```bash
0gchaind keys unsafe-export-eth-key "wallet"
```

### Backup the Validator Key

The validator key is located here:

```
/root/.0gchain/config/priv_validator_key.json
```

Copy this file to your local machine. This is your most important key as a validator. Losing it means losing control of your validator.

If you’ve never made a backup before, it's recommended to back up the entire config folder:

```bash
cp -r /root/.0gchain/config /path/to/backup/location
```

## Part 2: Restoring the Node and Wallet

### Install a Fresh Node and Sync the Blockchain

Follow the instructions to install a new node and wait until the blockchain is fully synced.

> 💡 _Tip: Refer to the official 0G documentation or installation guide to set up the new node._

### Stop the New Node Before Restoration

```bash
sudo systemctl stop 0gd
```

> ⚠️ **Important Warning**
>
> Make sure the old VPS node is stopped. **Never run two nodes** using the same `priv_validator_key.json`, as this will cause **double signing** and could result in slashing.

### Restore Validator Key

Copy and replace the previously backed up `priv_validator_key.json` into:

```
/root/.0gchain/config/
```

### Restore Wallet

#### From Private Key:

```bash
0gchaind keys unsafe-import-eth-key "wallet_name" "privatekey"
```

#### From Mnemonic Phrase:

```bash
0gchaind keys add "wallet" --eth --recover
```

### Restart the Node

```bash
sudo systemctl start 0gd
```

### Validate the Node and Validator Status

Make sure everything is operating correctly by checking your node and validator status:

```bash
0gchaind status
```

Or check validator info:

```bash
0gchaind q staking validator $(0gchaind keys show wallet --bech val -a)
```

> ⚠️ **Caution**
>
> - Always back up critical data before any major actions.
> - Store your keys and backups in a secure, preferably offline, location (e.g. hardware wallet, encrypted USB, or offline password manager).
> - Never share your private key or mnemonic phrase with anyone. Beware of phishing sites or impersonators.
> - Double-check every operation involving your validator to avoid risks like slashing. Ensure the chain ID, gas fees, and validator address are correct.

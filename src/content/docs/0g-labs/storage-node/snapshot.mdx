# üöÄ Using Snapshots for 0G Storage Node

> **Note:** While we provide snapshots for convenience, syncing from genesis is still the most secure and reliable method. Use snapshots only if you fully understand the risks involved.

---

## üü¢ Snapshot Status

**Status:** üü¢ **Available**

The latest snapshot is available for download. Using it can significantly reduce the sync time. Depending on your system‚Äôs performance, it may take approximately **1 to 2 hours** to catch up to the latest block.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Without a snapshot, syncing from genesis may take **1 to 2 days or more**.
